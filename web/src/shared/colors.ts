// Registry of the colours the backend may name: name -> three steps of one hue.
//
// One backend names colours from this set: research groups (`research/colors.py::GROUP_COLORS`, a
// palette the user picks from, served by the `group_colors` MCP tool). The names are the contract
// with it (a stored value is a name, never a hex), the same way `@/shared/icons.ts` holds the icon
// half — this file is the other half. Keeping the hexes here rather than in `main.scss` is
// deliberate: these are *data* — a set the user picks from, indexed by a name that travels to the
// database — while `main.scss` holds the app's own tokens, which are referenced by role and never
// enumerated. A name outside the registry is not an error: the value is not validated on the way
// in, so an unknown name falls back to the app accent rather than painting nothing.
//
// THE STEPS. Nine hues 40° apart around the wheel — so no two names have to be told apart by a
// shade — plus a neutral. Every hue is frozen at three lightness levels (OKLCH L 0.80 / 0.62 /
// 0.47, chroma asked for 0.20 and fitted down to the sRGB gamut per hue and level, with the
// utility in `docs/frontend/rules.md`). Lightness is what stays equal across the set — the
// swatches read as one family, and the two readable steps keep the contrast measured below
// whichever hue is picked; chroma is whatever each hue can still hold there. `light` is the
// readable tone on dark, `deep` the readable tone on light, `mid` the flat fill of a swatch. Both
// readable tones were measured against the plate they land on — the surface plus a 14% tint of
// the tone itself — and the worst pair in the set is 5.16:1, above the 4.5 AA asks for.
//
// How a step becomes a paintable role is not decided here: the vars go onto an element carrying
// the `.color-tones` class and `main.scss` resolves them for the active theme
// (see `shared/colorTones.ts`).
