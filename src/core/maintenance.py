"""Maintenance flag — «an update is in progress, do not launch anything».

Two files at the **project root**, not under `runtime/<APP_ENV>/`: `runtime/maintenance.lock`, an
advisory lock the kernel releases however the updater dies, and `runtime/maintenance.json`, the
readable half — who holds it, since when and why. The lock is the mutual exclusion between two
updaters; the JSON is what every other process reads, and it is active only while its pid is
still the process that wrote it. `begin` raises `MaintenanceHeld` when someone got there first,
`end` releases both. Imports stay at the process table and the stdlib: the flag is read before
`Config()` and before any database import.
