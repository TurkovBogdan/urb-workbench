"""Starting `update.sh` from inside the installation it is about to stop.

The other entry points to the same sequence are a human in a terminal and `app.py update`; this
one is the button on the About page, and it is separate because it cannot wait for the result —
the second step of that sequence kills this process.

Hence the requirements, one line each below: a **detached** session (a child of the backend dies
with it, halfway through a merge), an output sink that outlives the parent (the terminal is long
gone), and two refusals — one for another updater already at work, one for a checkout the
sequence would reject anyway.

It hands over to the script rather than calling `run_update` in-process: the script re-executes
itself through `uv run`, so the update runs on the dependencies it has just synced.
