"""Stopping every process of THIS install, from what those processes recorded about themselves.

`plan_stop` is a pure function — records and a process table in, a `StopPlan` out, with the reason
for every decision; `plan_live_stop` runs it against the live machine; `execute_stop` signals a
plan and proves the processes are gone. A plan is signalled only through `execute_stop`, and only
after `refuse_if_unsafe` finds nothing unaccounted for.

The unit of stopping is a **membership**, not a snapshot: a POSIX process group holds whatever its
members spawn, while a ppid walk loses a child whose parent died first, races pid reuse, and never
sees a process born after the table was read. A group is signalled only when every one of its live
members is explained by the registry — otherwise the same processes are stopped one pid at a time,
because the terminal's group can hold the operator's shell, an MCP shim or the agent session.
