"""The sweep: which processes in a table *look* like this checkout's, on evidence alone.

This was the updater's main mechanism and is now its stray detector. `select_kill_targets` is a
pure function over a process table (`Process` records in, `KillTarget`s out with the reason each
matched) and signals nothing at all; `src/core/update/stop.py` decides what happens to a find.

The demotion is the point. The key here is `cwd` plus an argv token — fields readable only for
one's own user on macOS, obtainable on Windows only by reading another process's memory, and
rewritable by the process itself. So a find of this sweep is evidence that something unaccounted
for is running, not permission to signal it: the install's own processes are known from the
registry instead (`src/core/process_registry.py`).
