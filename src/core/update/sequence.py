"""`app.py update`: fast-forward this checkout to `origin/<UPDATE_BRANCH>`, sync dependencies,
back the database up, migrate it and start the install back up.

`run_update` walks the steps and returns the process exit code (`EXIT_*`); everything it does to
the world goes through `UpdateHost`, which `DryRunHost` replaces with a narration.

`stop_command` is the stopping step offered on its own (`app.py stop`), for a launcher script or
an operator who only wants the install down. It keeps the update's refusals and exit codes: an
install that could not be stopped completely must not be reported as stopped, whoever asked.
