"""HTTP surface of the update (mounted at /internal/core/update).

Three routes for three costs. `GET ""` is local and instant — it is what the About page opens
with. `POST "/check"` fetches, so it is slow, may fail, and is a POST because it changes the
checkout's tracking refs. `POST "/start"` hands the installation over to `update.sh` and answers
before this process goes down.

The handlers are **sync** on purpose: each one shells out to git, and a blocking call in an
`async def` would freeze the event loop — health, MCP and every other page with it. FastAPI runs
a `def` handler in a threadpool.

No `@guard` here: the zone default applies, so the day an auth module arrives these routes are
covered by it. A route that can stop the installation must not be the one that opted out.
