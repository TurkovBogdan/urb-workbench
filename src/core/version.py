"""Release of this checkout — `[project] version` in `pyproject.toml`.

The number lives where a Python project already keeps it, so there is no manifest of our own to
add, to remember or to let drift. `web/package.json` and `uv.lock` copy it; everything served at
runtime (the MCP server banner, the About page) reads it from here, and so does the update: the
version a branch offers is `git show <ref>:pyproject.toml`.

An absent number is `None`, not a number: a checkout older than this scheme, or a branch that
predates it, has no version, and saying `0.0.0` there would be indistinguishable from a real
release. `app_version()` is the one place that substitutes a string, because the MCP banner has
nowhere to put a `None`.
