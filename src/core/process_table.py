"""The live process table: who is running, under whom, from where, and since when.

Read through `psutil` rather than `/proc`, because the updater has to stop the processes of its
own installation on whatever the operator runs — and procfs is Linux-only, so a macOS install
crashed on `os.listdir("/proc")` before it stopped anything (2026-09-12).

A process this user may not read is left out of the table entirely: it is also a process this
program could not have signalled. Liveness, on the other hand, does NOT hide that case: a process
of another user is alive and writing, and treating it as dead is how a migration ends up running
beside a live writer.
